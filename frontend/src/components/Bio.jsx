            I am a full-stack JavaScript software engineer making a career
            change from hospitality and labor. I am passionate about creating
            dynamic user experiences and learning new technologies. I want to
            merge my passions together to create powerful applications designed
            with the user in mind every step of the way. I have experience
            leading a team, with the AGILE/Scrum dynamic lending itself to my
            natural disposition. My training has been with NodeJs, React,
            JavaScript, TypeScript, and AWS.
